                    <p>
                        Hello there! My name is Sakshi Jha and I am a 3rd year undergraduate student majoring in
                        Electronics and Communication Engineering. I have also completed a diploma in ECE, which has
                        helped me build a strong foundation in electronics and communication engineering.

                        Along with my academic qualifications, I am also working as a Frontend Developer. This
                        experience has helped me develop my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and has given me
                        an opportunity to put my theoretical knowledge into practice.

                        I am passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites that not only look great but
                        also provide a seamless user experience. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and
                        finding innovative solutions that meet the needs of my clients.

                        In addition to my technical skills, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual with a keen eye
                        for detail. I am always eager to learn and keep myself updated with the latest trends and
                        technologies in frontend development.

                        When I am not working on web development projects or studying, I like to spend my free time
                        reading books, watching movies, and exploring new places.

                        Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I look forward to the opportunity
                        to work with you and contribute my skills to your project!

                <h3>Sakshi Jha</h3>
                <h4>Python Trainee</h4>
                <p>
                    I am thrilled to share my experience of the 6-week training program in Python programming that I
                    underwent with Coursera.

                    The training program was an intensive and comprehensive experience that provided me with a deep
                    understanding of Python programming language. The program was designed by experienced professionals
                    who had a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field, which made the learning experience even
                    more valuable.

                    The training program was divided into weekly modules that covered various concepts and applications
                    of Python programming. Each module included a mix of lectures, quizzes, and assignments, which
                    helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and their practical applications.

                <p>
                    I am pleased to share my experience of the 6-week training program in Signaling and
                    Telecommunication that I underwent with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.

                    The training program was an intensive and hands-on experience that provided me with a deep
                    understanding of the signaling and telecommunication systems used in the metro rail industry. The
                    program was conducted by experienced professionals who had a wealth of knowledge and experience in
                    the field, which made the learning experience even more valuable.

                    The training program was divided into both theoretical and practical sessions, which helped me gain
                    a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and their practical applications. During the
                    theoretical sessions, we covered topics such as railway signaling principles, interlocking systems,
                    and communication systems used in the metro rail industry.

                    The practical sessions were conducted in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's training center and gave
                    me an opportunity to work with state-of-the-art equipment used in signaling and telecommunication
                    systems. I was able to gain practical experience in configuring, testing, and troubleshooting
                    various signaling and telecommunication systems.

                        <h3>PCB Designing and Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The project I worked on involved designing and implementing Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
                            layouts for three different electronic systems: a remote-controlled LED blinking system, an
                            oscillator, and a sun tracking system.

                            The first system was a remote-controlled LED blinking system. The system consisted of a
                            microcontroller, infrared receiver, and LED array.
                            The second system was an oscillator, which consisted of a timer chip and a set of capacitors
                            and resistors.
                            The third system was a sun tracking system, which used light sensors and a motor to rotate a
                            solar panel to track the sun's movement throughout the day.

                        <h3>Tic Tac Toe game using Python</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking X's and
                            O's in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
                            vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In this project, we will create a simple Tic Tac
                            Toe game using Python programming language.

                            To begin with, we will create a 3x3 grid using a nested list in Python. We will represent
                            the X and O marks using the characters 'X' and 'O', respectively. We will then display the
                            grid on the console and prompt the first player to make their move.
